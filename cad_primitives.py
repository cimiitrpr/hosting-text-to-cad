cad_primitives.py
-----------------
A small helper library the LLM is instructed (via the system prompt) to call
for anything beyond a single primitive shape.

Why this exists:
    Asking an LLM to freehand raw CadQuery for something like "a car chassis"
    from nothing produces unreliable, often-broken code, because it has to
    get dozens of coordinates right in one shot. Instead, we give it a small
    vocabulary of pre-tested building blocks (beams, rails, cross-members,
    mounting holes) and instruct it to *compose* those. This is the same
    "constrained generation" idea used in real production LLM-codegen tools:
    shrink the model's problem from "write correct low-level code" to
    "pick the right high-level calls and numbers."

This file gets copied next to the generated script at execution time so
`from cad_primitives import *` works inside the sandboxed subprocess.
